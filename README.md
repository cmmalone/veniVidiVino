veniVidiVino
============

in vino veritas. Ex vino venit libido.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------


	1.  run vineAndBranches.py ($> python vineAndBranches.py ).  This will create the wine tree, which is a dictionary under the hood and gets stored in train/tree.p via pickle.
	2.  run growHarvestPress ($> python growHarvestPress.py ).  This will create the training cellar (bottleLabel objects with wine names, pairings, descriptions, etc. for the training set). 
	3.  run veniViniVido.py as before, giving input where it asks for it.  You want to do the other steps first so that the files that it looks for exist.
